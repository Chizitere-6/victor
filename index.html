    <pre>The bible says it's a good thing to give thanks to the Lord, amen
        I come before You today
        And there's just one thing that I want to say
        Thank you, Lord
        Thank you, Lord
        For all You've given to me
        For all the blessings that I cannot see
        Thank you, Lord
        Thank you, Lord
        With a grateful heart
        With a song of praise
        With an outstretched arm
        I will bless Your name
        Thank you, Lord
        I just wanna thank you, Lord
        Thank you, Lord
        I just wanna thank you, Lord

        For all You've done in my life
        You took my darkness and gave me Your light
        Thank you, Lord
        Thank you, Lord
        You took my sin and my shame
        You took my sickness and healed all my pain
        Thank you, Lord
        Thank you, Lord
        With a grateful heart
        With a song of praise

        I will bless Your name
        And thank you, Lord
